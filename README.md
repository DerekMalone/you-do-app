# YOU-DO App

## Overview
This application allows users to create an active list of "to-do's". The users list of "to-do's" can be created, completed, edited, and deleted as the user sees fit. The user can also filter the "to-do's" that are rendered on the DOM via the navigation menu. The user can view only "to-do's" that have not yet been completed, only "to-do's" that have been completed, or a list of all "to-do's" regardless of being completed or uncompleted.
